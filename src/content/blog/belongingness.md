In our journey through life, there's an often overlooked but crucial aspect that shapes our experiences - the sense of belonging. Today, we'll delve into the profound impact of belonging, its significance in our lives, and how you can cultivate it.

## The Roots Of Belongingness

- One thing that people don't realize about the sense of belonging is that it begins within us. And that is something that I did not understand few years ago. I didn't feel like I belonged and I  believed the issue was the people when in reality it was me.
  - Many of us, at times, feel the need to wear a mask, concealing our true selves. This act undermines the essence of belonging, signaling to our subconscious that we don't truly fit in and that we feel the need to wear a mask to feel safe and valued
  - Going through life is a war and fighting it out all by yourself is not how you win a war. And putting a mask on is even worse because that is like going on a war against yourself
- after reflecting on my past experiences and why I felt the need to put on a mask. I came up with a very profound realization.
  - the root cause of me feeling like I didn't belong anywhere was in the fact that I did not value myself
  - You see when you don't value yourself, how do you expect other people to value you?
  - The value you place on yourself echoes in how the world perceives you
  - Belonging transcends individual relationships; it extends to our connection with the universe, with god. When you believe you have a strong purpose in this universe, a sense of belonging within yourself naturally follows.
  - Another important point to notice is that you feel like you belong in the place you contribute to.
  - A lot of people, including me, find it hard to find people who are similar to you. I know a lot of people think that that should stop them from belonging to certain groups because no one's like you. But in reality, we're all able to bond no matter whether we're similar or different. I think that's the beauty of us, of us humans. No matter our differences, we're still able to belong to each other, to bond as families, as friends, as whatever. Because what really matters is how you perceive yourself in relation to the world. Fuck the world, fuck the people. It all starts within you. And from there, when you grow that seed within you, you'll be able to use your strong growing roots to connect with other groups of plants.

## Positive feedback loops in belonging

- Based on what we discussed, we can notice 2 positive feedback loops that we can take advantage of
  - when you value yourself, others will value you, and when others value you, you value yourself
  - When you voluntarily contribute to a certain group, the more you feel like you belong to that group, and when you feel like you belong to that group, you contribute more to it.
- But remember, Authenticity is key, allow your kindness to emanate naturally from your heart, as most individuals can discern between genuine warmth and insincere gestures.

## Summary

the sense of belonging is woven from the threads of authenticity, self-value, and a connection to something greater. As you navigate through life, remember that you are never alone. Embrace the true self you wanna be, contribute your unique value, and you'll find that the world, in all its vastness, is a place where you truly belong
