Starting a new internship or junior position can be an exciting but challenging experience. I believe, just like any experience in life, it's what you make out of it, so in this article, we will explore six valuable pieces of advice to help you navigate this new phase of your life.

### Embrace Being New

One of the key pieces of advice is to embrace your newness. Don't be afraid to speak out and offer your opinions during meetings. Your fresh perspective can bring valuable insights to the team. This is particularly relevant for those whose positions are not directly related to technology but work in tech-based companies, such as UX/UI designers or marketers. Their unique perspective, unburdened by the technicalities of coding, can lead to innovative and creative ideas.

### Overcoming Impostor Syndrome and Finding Belonging

It's normal to feel overwhelmed and experience impostor syndrome when starting a new role. Remember that your colleagues were once in the same position as you. Embrace the mindset of a learner, ask questions, and be curious. When seeking assistance, provide important context and explain what you've already tried to avoid wasting time. By actively participating and contributing to discussions, you will feel a greater sense of belonging and overcome the impostor syndrome.

### Planning and Learning

Effective planning is crucial for success. Take the time to explore different ways of learning and develop effective strategies for completing tasks. Before diving into a new assignment, gather the necessary background information. Seek guidance from senior team members when needed, as it can save time and accelerate your progress.

Especially in your first few weeks, it's good to gain wisdom from them. Always overestimate completion dates, especially for unfamiliar tasks.

### Knowing Your Purpose

Understanding your "why" is essential not only for your work but also for your life. Reflect on your personal motivations and long-term goals. Knowing your purpose will serve as fuel to keep you motivated and focused. Consider how your internship aligns with your overall goals and set specific objectives to accomplish during this period. Create systems that allow you to consistently progress towards your goals. Finding your purpose and setting systems will help you find fulfillment and make the most of your internship.

### Money Management and Investing in Yourself

As a first-time intern, you may experience an increase in income, making it an ideal time to learn about money management. While specific financial advice is beyond the scope of this article, consider investing in unique experiences and personal growth. Allocate your resources towards opportunities that enhance your skills and knowledge. Investing in courses, improving your appearance, or prioritizing your health and fitness are all examples of self-investment. Remember, the greatest return on investment comes from investing in yourself.

### Embracing a New Environment and Its Opportunities

Transitioning into a new environment can be challenging, but it also presents unique opportunities for growth. Fully embrace the experience and be present in the moment. Recognize that new environments offer a chance to reinvent yourself and explore different aspects of your personality. Take time to reflect on what you want to achieve during your internship and visualize your desired outcomes. By immersing yourself in the experience and maintaining a sense of oneness, you'll be able to make the most of the opportunities around you.
