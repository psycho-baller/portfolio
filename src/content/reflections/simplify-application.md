## Q: Tell us about your experiences with prompt engineering!

During my internship with IBM, I developed Mark, a web app for online course authors to create AI-graded assignments. As a result, learners receive instantaneous, personalized AI generated feedback for their submissions.
Learned how to prompt GPT-4 to accurately grade the learner's submissions based on the author's rubric
Led a team of three developers in building the project.
Using NextJS 14, I designed and implemented the frontend architecture to work well with our REST based Nest.js backend.
Maintained code quality through regular code reviews, ensuring adherence to best practices and optimizing performance.

In terms of personal projects, I've worked with LLMs to solve unique problems I, and a lot of other people face. Here are some of these projects:

- sniptube.tech - Easily highlight, tag, annotate, and export your favorite YouTube moments with a click of a button. Plus, with the magic of AI, it generates summaries for these snips, making it a breeze to revisit (Winner of best AI project in Boost Hacks Hackathon) (browser extension + Python serverless functions + NextJS marketing site)
- https://github.com/psycho-baller/shopiwise - Your personal shopping companion designed to empower mindful purchasing decisions (browser extension + Go serverless functions)
- https://github.com/psycho-baller/journal-genius Journal Genius is a groundbreaking application that utilizes cutting-edge LLMs and vector databases to analyze journaling text and generate actionable takeaways (website + obsidian plugin)


## Q: What is one improvement you'd make to Simplify?

- Leveraging the data the user shares with us and (with their permission) make their experience more personalized
- More automations and integrations with other task managers like todoist or example to track our applications
- These days it is becoming very important to apply ASAP before everyone else fills their application. So it would be a good strategy to be known as a company that gets the "LATEST job applications straight to your fingertips"
- If y'all decide to take one of my ideas, I'd appreciate it if you attribute some credit to me. Don't be like https://bereal.com They started rolling out one of my ideas to production few weeks after I suggested it (Spotify integration feature)
