2: A huge fan of what you 5 are doing and I would love to be a +1 to the team, but before that,
4: I'm transiting through ZRH(layover 6:10-13:25; may 10), and will try to leave the airport and if that's possible I would love to meet you guys in person. I wanna learn about you guys' journey and if you want we could make a podcast episode (and maybe catch a game of table tennisðŸ˜‰)
5: Why I'm a great fit: I am currently doing a SWE internship @IBM and will be done exactly one year from now. Currently I wouldn't really provide unique benefit by joining your team but I will be in a year, I have a few project ideas related to AI that I am working on almost everyday. Right now I can mainly offer web dev (3D, front-end, back-end) and basic Flutter (in the process of learning). You can find more info about what I build in my [github](https://github.com/psycho-baller)
6: Thank you for every second you guys put into Snipd... and reading this message
P.S: I would love to meet up with all of you but I'm also down to meet with whoever is available and willing to meet up`,
