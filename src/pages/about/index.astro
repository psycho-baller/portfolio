        What is your why?

      <p class="">
        Connecting with people is a fundamental part of who I am, and this philosophy seeps into every area of my life.
        Discovering programming was a true blessing as it has become my primary medium for connecting with the world and
        making a difference. I find profound purpose in improving people's health by developing cutting-edge software
        products, drawing heavily on the latest scientific and psychological research. Other mediums include content
        creation in the form of blogs or <a

        a new country, starting a new job, or exploring a new technology.

        What do you enjoy building?
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        What truly drives me is my passion for building impactful software solutions that leverage cutting-edge
        technologies. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of app/web development and technologies like AI, LLMs
        (Large Language Models), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), and UX (User Experience). By connecting these realms,
        I aim to create innovative applications that solve complex problems with a focus on designing intuitive and
        delightful user experiences.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        If you're looking for someone who can bridge the gap between app/web development, cutting-edge technologies, and
        user-centric design, all while utilizing the latest scientific and psychological research, I believe I could be
        a valuable addition to your team.
